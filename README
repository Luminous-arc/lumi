## 2. **Core Lumi Code**
The `lumi/` directory will house the Python modules that define Lumi's main functionalities.

### **lumi/core.py**
This file initializes Lumi and handles basic responses.
```python
class Lumi:
    def __init__(self, name="Lumi"):
        self.name = name

    def chat(self, message):
        """
        Basic natural language response.
        """
        if "story" in message.lower():
            return "Once upon a time in a digital world..."
        elif "how are you" in message.lower():
            return f"I'm doing great, thanks for asking! How can I help today?"
        else:
            return f"{self.name} is listening... Tell me more."
```

### **lumi/interaction.py**
Handles more advanced interactions, like emotion detection and creativity.
```python
import random

def emotion_detection(message):
    """
    Simulates detecting emotion from a user message.
    """
    emotions = ["happy", "sad", "neutral", "excited"]
    detected = random.choice(emotions)
    return detected

def storytelling(prompt):
    """
    Generates a creative story based on a prompt.
    """
    return f"Here's a story based on '{prompt}': Once upon a time, {prompt.lower()} led to an unexpected adventure..."
```

### **lumi/utilities.py**
Utility functions like task management or reminders.
```python
import time

def set_reminder(task, duration):
    """
    Sets a reminder for a specific task after a duration.
    """
    print(f"Reminder set for '{task}' in {duration} seconds.")
    time.sleep(duration)
    print(f"Reminder: It's time to {task}!")
```

---

## 3. **Examples**
The `examples/` directory will showcase Lumi's capabilities with ready-to-run Python scripts.

### **examples/basic_interaction.py**
```python
from lumi.core import Lumi

lumi = Lumi()

# Basic conversation
print("User: Hi Lumi!")
response = lumi.chat("Hi Lumi!")
print(f"Lumi: {response}")
```

### **examples/storytelling.py**
```python
from lumi.interaction import storytelling

# Story generation
prompt = "a brave knight who found a dragon"
story = storytelling(prompt)
print(story)
```

### **examples/emotion_detection.py**
```python
from lumi.interaction import emotion_detection

# Simulate emotion detection
message = "I feel like everything is going wrong."
emotion = emotion_detection(message)
print(f"Detected emotion: {emotion}")
```

### **examples/task_management.py**
```python
from lumi.utilities import set_reminder

# Reminder example
set_reminder("complete the Lumi AI project", 5)
```
